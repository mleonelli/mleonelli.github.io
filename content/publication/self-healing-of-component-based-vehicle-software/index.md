title: Self-healing of component based vehicle software
publication_types:
  - "7"
authors:
  - MauroLeonelli
abstract: Automotive industry is moving towards a new, highly-scalable and
  modular embedded architecture developed on component based software and
  powerful platforms. Moreover increasing complexity will make current approach
  no longer manageable. Such a system would beneﬁt from the introduction of
  self-capabilities to enhance performance, safety and life-span. This master
  thesis presents a self-healing module that enables faults all over the system
  to be detected, localized and solved using a rule based-engine. Then it is
  analyzed the limit of a pure centralized approach and a solution is found in
  the dynamic installation of the self-healing module on diﬀerent platforms in
  the network, based on a leader election algorithm.
