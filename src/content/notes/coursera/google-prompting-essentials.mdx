The T.C.R.E.I. Framework

    Task: Clearly define what you want the AI to do, including a specific persona (e.g., a marketing executive) and desired output format (e.g., bulleted list).
    Context: Provide all necessary details to help the AI understand your request, such as budget constraints or specific preferences.
    References: Offer examples or past information to guide the AI in generating more useful and relevant outputs.

Evaluating and Iterating for Better Results

    Evaluate: After receiving an output, assess if it meets your needs and aligns with your initial request.
    Iterate: If the output isn't satisfactory, refine your prompt by adding more information or making adjustments, then try again.

The Importance of Iteration

    Even with a guiding framework, initial prompts may not yield perfect results, making iteration crucial for refining and clarifying your requests.
    Iterating within the same chat allows the AI tool to build upon previous information, leading to more targeted and sharper outputs.

Four Iteration Methods

    Revisit the Prompting Framework: Ensure your prompt clearly defines the task, includes a specific persona and format, provides ample context, and offers relevant references.
    Break the Prompt into Shorter Sentences: Instead of a single complex prompt, address each step individually in separate prompts to achieve your desired outcome.
    Tweak Your Phrasing or Switch to an Analogous Task: Rephrase your request or try a similar but different task to trigger new responses from the AI.
    Introduce Constraints: Add limitations to your prompt regarding categories, length, format, or other details to guide the AI toward more precise and inventive results.

Ethical Risks and AI Limitations

    Generative AI tools can produce outputs with mistakes, biases, stereotypes, and misleading information due to their lack of critical thinking and human awareness.
    A "human-in-the-loop" approach is crucial, requiring users to verify all AI-generated content before use.

Navigating Common Issues

    Biases and Stereotypes: To avoid these, specify diversity in prompts (e.g., "delicious foods from all over the world") and challenge biased responses by asking the tool to correct them.
    Hallucinations: When AI provides false information, fact-check and cross-reference outputs using search engines or experts. Use clearer and more detailed language in prompts to prevent misunderstandings.
    Inconsistencies and Relevance Issues: Provide references and more context in your prompts to ensure the AI understands your request, especially with idioms or colloquialisms.

Responsible Prompting and Workplace Considerations

    Before using generative AI for work, consider if it aligns with your goals, company policies, and potential risks to sensitive data.
    Always evaluate AI-generated content, disclose your use of AI, and periodically clear the AI tool's memory to protect privacy, avoid bias, and improve accuracy.
