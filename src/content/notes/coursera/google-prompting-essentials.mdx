The T.C.R.E.I. Framework

    Task: Clearly define what you want the AI to do, including a specific persona (e.g., a marketing executive) and desired output format (e.g., bulleted list).
    Context: Provide all necessary details to help the AI understand your request, such as budget constraints or specific preferences.
    References: Offer examples or past information to guide the AI in generating more useful and relevant outputs.

Evaluating and Iterating for Better Results

    Evaluate: After receiving an output, assess if it meets your needs and aligns with your initial request.
    Iterate: If the output isn't satisfactory, refine your prompt by adding more information or making adjustments, then try again.

The Importance of Iteration

    Even with a guiding framework, initial prompts may not yield perfect results, making iteration crucial for refining and clarifying your requests.
    Iterating within the same chat allows the AI tool to build upon previous information, leading to more targeted and sharper outputs.

Four Iteration Methods

    Revisit the Prompting Framework: Ensure your prompt clearly defines the task, includes a specific persona and format, provides ample context, and offers relevant references.
    Break the Prompt into Shorter Sentences: Instead of a single complex prompt, address each step individually in separate prompts to achieve your desired outcome.
    Tweak Your Phrasing or Switch to an Analogous Task: Rephrase your request or try a similar but different task to trigger new responses from the AI.
    Introduce Constraints: Add limitations to your prompt regarding categories, length, format, or other details to guide the AI toward more precise and inventive results.
