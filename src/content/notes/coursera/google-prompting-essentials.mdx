The T.C.R.E.I. Framework

    Task: Clearly define what you want the AI to do, including a specific persona (e.g., a marketing executive) and desired output format (e.g., bulleted list).
    Context: Provide all necessary details to help the AI understand your request, such as budget constraints or specific preferences.
    References: Offer examples or past information to guide the AI in generating more useful and relevant outputs.

Evaluating and Iterating for Better Results

    Evaluate: After receiving an output, assess if it meets your needs and aligns with your initial request.
    Iterate: If the output isn't satisfactory, refine your prompt by adding more information or making adjustments, then try again.
